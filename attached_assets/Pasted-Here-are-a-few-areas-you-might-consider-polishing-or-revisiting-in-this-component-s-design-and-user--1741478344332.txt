Here are a few areas you might consider polishing or revisiting in this component’s design and user experience:

Redundancy in Labels vs. Question Text

You currently show “Question 1” followed by “Are you looking to buy, sell or rent?”
Because you already have a clear question title (“Are you looking to…?”), having both “Question 1” and that text can feel redundant. Consider letting the user rename the question or simply removing the “Question #” label so the UI is less cluttered.
Hierarchy & Grouping

Think about giving each question its own “card” or bounding box, so users quickly see which controls (like the question prompt, answer type, delete button) belong together. A subtle card with a heading “Question X” and the actual question text below can help visually chunk each question and make reordering or editing more intuitive.
Question Types & Settings

Right now, it appears you can see only the question prompt and the delete button. Yet form builders often require users to choose input types, set whether it’s required, add help text, etc.
You might add a small sub-panel or “gear” icon to expand additional settings (required/optional, validation, placeholder text, etc.) so the user can configure each question in one place.
Reordering & Editing

A key feature of form builders is the ability to easily rearrange questions. Make sure it’s clear how to drag/reorder them (with a handle or up/down arrows).
Also, ensure that “edit” actions (such as changing the question text) are obviously available. The current screenshot primarily shows a drop-down and a delete (“x”) icon—visually, there’s not a dedicated spot for editing or reordering yet.
Consistency & Clarity

The first two are single-text questions, while the third is labeled “Multi Choice.” If the first two are text responses, maybe label them as well (e.g., “Single Line Text” or “Short Answer”) so you’re consistent about showing question types.
This helps end-users see at a glance what type each question is (especially if they have many questions in the form).
