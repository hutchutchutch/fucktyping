# JSX and React Component Practices

- Use TypeScript for all new React components (.tsx extension)
- Use proper component destructuring for props
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript interfaces
- Use functional components with hooks
- Properly manage component state with useState and useReducer
- Use context API for global state management when appropriate
- Implement proper error boundaries for component error handling
- Use proper key props for list rendering
- Avoid inline anonymous functions in render methods when possible
- Use proper memoization (useMemo, useCallback) for expensive operations
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract complex rendering logic into smaller components
- Use proper React event handling
- Follow consistent naming conventions for components and props
- Implement proper loading and error states for async operations
