# Frontend Component Standards

## Tailwind CSS Usage

- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling across the frontend
- Refer to design tokens defined in tailwind.config.ts for consistent styling
- Use the HSL color variables for theming (e.g., `text-primary`, `bg-background`)
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles
- Use Tailwind's utility classes over custom CSS when possible
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Implement dark mode support using the `dark:` variant

## shadcn/ui Components

- Use shadcn/ui components from the `components/ui` directory
- Maintain consistency with the shadcn/ui component patterns
- Extend shadcn components rather than creating duplicative ones
- Use the theme variables provided by the shadcn system
- Ensure proper accessibility for all components
- Style shadcn components using the design system tokens

## Component Structure

- Use function components with named exports
- Define component props using TypeScript interfaces
- Follow a consistent naming convention for components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper semantic HTML elements
- Structure components with consistent patterns
