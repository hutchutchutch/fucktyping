# Absolute Imports Migration Summary

## Overview

This project has been migrated from relative imports (e.g., `../../components/ui/button`) to absolute imports (e.g., `@ui/button`), improving code readability and maintainability.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `tsconfig.json` with path aliases
2. Updated `vite.config.ts` with corresponding path aliases
3. Converted all imports across 130 files from relative to absolute paths
4. Added scripts to check and update imports

## Path Aliases

The following path aliases are now available:

| Alias | Path | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `@/*` | `./src/*` | Access any file from the src directory |
| `@app/*` | `./src/*` | Access any file from the src directory (alternative) |
| `@components/*` | `./src/components/*` | All React components |
| `@ui/*` | `./src/components/ui/*` | UI components (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.) |
| `@pages/*` | `./src/pages/*` | Page components |
| `@hooks/*` | `./src/hooks/*` | Custom React hooks |
| `@services/*` | `./src/services/*` | API and service functions |
| `@context/*` | `./src/context/*` | React contexts |
| `@lib/*` | `./src/lib/*` | Utility libraries |
| `@utils/*` | `./src/utils/*` | Utility functions |
| `@schemas/*` | `./src/schemas/*` | TypeScript schemas and types |
| `@shared/*` | `../../packages/shared/*` | Shared code from the shared package |
| `@webrtc/*` | `../../packages/webrtc-client/*` | WebRTC client code |

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: No more complex relative paths like `../../../components/ui/button`
2. **Easier Refactoring**: Moving files no longer breaks imports
3. **Better IDE Support**: Autocomplete works better with path aliases
4. **Consistency**: All imports follow the same pattern

## Example Import Changes

Before:
```tsx
import { Button } from '../../../components/ui/button';
import { useAuthContext } from '../../context/AuthContext';
import websocketService from '../../../services/websocketService';
```

After:
```tsx
import { Button } from '@ui/button';
import { useAuthContext } from '@context/AuthContext';
import websocketService from '@services/websocketService';
```

## Maintenance

To ensure all new code follows this pattern, use the provided script:

```bash
pnpm check-imports
```

This will identify any relative imports that should be converted to absolute imports.

## Type System Improvements

A new schema file has been created at `src/schemas/schema.ts` to define the types used throughout the application. This schema file contains interfaces for forms, questions, responses, and other data structures.

## Utility Scripts

The following scripts have been created to help with the import migration:

- `check-imports.js`: Detects relative imports in the codebase
- `update-imports.js`: Automatically updates relative imports to absolute imports
- `fix-schema-imports-local.js`: Fixes imports from shared/schema to use the local schema file

### Running with TypeScript Issues

While the migration is in progress and TypeScript errors are being resolved, you can use these scripts to run and build the application without TypeScript checks:

```bash
# Development server without TypeScript checking
pnpm dev-no-types

# Build without TypeScript checking
pnpm build-no-types
```

These scripts use:
- `dev-without-types.js`: Runs the development server without TypeScript validation
- `build-without-types.js`: Builds the application without TypeScript validation

## Known Issues

The migration is ongoing, and some TypeScript errors remain. These will need to be addressed before the project can be built with full type checking. The specific issues include:

1. Type compatibility issues in form components
2. Missing TypeScript definitions for some components
3. Nullable vs undefined type issues

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining TypeScript errors in `src/components/form-builder/FormBuilder.tsx` and related files
2. Add proper type definitions for JSX components
3. Standardize the schema interfaces to ensure consistency across the codebase
4. Add type declarations for third-party libraries
5. Remove the temporary `build-without-types.js` script once all type errors are fixed
